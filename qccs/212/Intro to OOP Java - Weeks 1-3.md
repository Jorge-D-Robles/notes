# Intro to OOP Java - Weeks 1-3

## Professor Lord

* Java is universal - can be run on any OS as long as it has a java interpreter. 
* In C++, you need to compile the binary code using different compilers depending on OS/architecture.

* Java has a compiler for Windows/Mac/Other for each OS, producing Java ```bytecode``` which is interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This standardizes many concepts such as the size of an int, which caps at 2,147,483,647. (Max cash stack of Runescape)
