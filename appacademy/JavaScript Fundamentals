# JavaScript Fundamentals

## Functions

To declare a function in JS, you use the ```function``` keyword. 
Ex: 

```js
function average(num1, num2) {
    return (num1 + num2) / 2;
}
```

**Important** - JS functions do not throw errors if the number of *arguments* passed into a function are different than the number or *parameters* listed during function declaration.

```js
function average(num1, num2) {
    return (num1 + num2) / 2;
}
> console.log(average(1, 2, 3, 4)); //averages 1 and 2. ignores 3 and 4.

> console.log(average(1)); // => NaN - Not A Number. Tries to average 1 and undefined.
```

***ALSO IMPORTANT*** - in JS, you don't just compare with ``` ==, and !=``` . JS is a dynamically typed language and tries it's best to adjust data types to fit what it thinks you want. For strict equality/inequality (checking for content AND ***Data Type***  see example below.

```js
let a = 10;
let b = '10';

console.log(a == b); //output: true
console.log(a === b); //output: false
```
